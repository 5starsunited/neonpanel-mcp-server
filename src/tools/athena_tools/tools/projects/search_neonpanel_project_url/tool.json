  "description": "Search for NeonPanel projects (Purchase Orders, FBA Shipments, Assembly Orders, etc.) and get their URLs.\n\nSEARCH OPTIONS:\n1. GENERAL SEARCH (search): Searches across project name, reference number, AND project key - USE THIS FOR EASIEST SEARCH\n   - Example: \"12345\" will find any project with \"12345\" in name, ref, or key\n   - Example: \"FBA\" will find all FBA shipments\n   - Searches are case-insensitive partial matches\n\n2. SPECIFIC FIELD SEARCH (project_name/project_ref_number/project_key): Search only one specific field\n   - project_name: Batch/project name (e.g., \"12/11/2025 DP_KP_HmP_SC KAI Sea-GYR3\")\n   - project_ref_number: Reference/order number (e.g., \"4024523804758\")\n   - project_key: System key format ProjectType-ID (e.g., \"FbaInboundShipment-40358\")\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Use 'search' parameter for flexibility unless you need exact field matching.",
