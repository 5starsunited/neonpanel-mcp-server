# Connecting Amazon Bedrock Agent to Keepa MCP Server

## ü§ñ **Overview**
This guide shows how to connect an Amazon Bedrock Agent to your deployed Keepa MCP Server for Amazon marketplace analysis and product research.

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- ‚úÖ Deployed Keepa MCP Server (AWS ECS)
- ‚úÖ Valid Keepa API key
- ‚úÖ AWS Account with Bedrock access
- ‚úÖ Bedrock Agent IAM permissions

## üöÄ **Step 1: Get Your API Endpoint**

After successful deployment, your CDK stack outputs will show:
```bash
# Get your endpoint URL
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name KeepaServerStack \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`LoadBalancerURL`].OutputValue' \
  --output text
```

Example output: `http://keepa-alb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`

## üîß **Step 2: Create Bedrock Agent Action Group**

### Action Group Configuration:
- **Name**: `keepa-marketplace-analysis`
- **Description**: `Amazon marketplace product analysis and research tools`
- **Action Group Type**: `API Schema`
- **API Schema Format**: `OpenAPI 3.0`

## üõ†Ô∏è **Step 3: Configure Bedrock Agent**

### 3.1 Create the Agent:
```bash
aws bedrock-agent create-agent \
  --agent-name "keepa-marketplace-analyst" \
  --description "Amazon marketplace analysis agent with Keepa data" \
  --foundation-model "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0" \
  --instruction "You are a marketplace analysis expert. Use Keepa tools to research Amazon products, analyze pricing trends, track sales velocity, and find profitable opportunities. Always include your Keepa API key in requests."
```

## üí¨ **Step 4: Test Your Agent**

### Example Conversation:
```
User: "Analyze the iPhone 15 Pro pricing trends and find similar products"

Agent: I'll help you analyze iPhone 15 Pro pricing trends using Keepa data.
[Agent uses lookupProduct, getPriceHistory, and findProducts]

Response: Based on Keepa analysis:
- Current price: $999.99
- 30-day trend: Stable with minor fluctuations  
- Sales rank: #3 in Cell Phones
- Similar products: [List of alternatives]
```

## üéØ **Use Cases**

1. **Product Research**: "Research gaming laptops under $1500"
2. **Competitive Analysis**: "Compare AirPods vs competing earbuds"
3. **Market Opportunities**: "Find kitchen appliances with declining prices"
4. **Price Monitoring**: "Track ASIN B08N5WRWNW price history"

## üö® **Important Notes**

1. **API Key Security**: Store Keepa API key in AWS Secrets Manager
2. **Rate Limiting**: Respect Keepa's API rate limits
3. **Cost Management**: Monitor Keepa token usage and AWS costs
4. **HTTPS**: Upgrade to HTTPS for production use

## üéâ **You're Ready!**

Your Bedrock Agent can now:
- ‚úÖ Analyze Amazon product data
- ‚úÖ Track pricing trends  
- ‚úÖ Research market opportunities
- ‚úÖ Monitor competitive landscapes
- ‚úÖ Provide data-driven insights
