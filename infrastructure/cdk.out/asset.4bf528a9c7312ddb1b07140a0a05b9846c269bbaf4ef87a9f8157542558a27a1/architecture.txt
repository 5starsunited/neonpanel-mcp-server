Here is how MCP servers should work: 

1. Keepa MCP - independend MCP server we run to let user use their Keepa API Key to let AI access their data. 
NO CONNECTION WITH NeonPanel. 

2. Neonpanel users can use their neonpanel a creditations Client ID and Client secret to 
obtain NeonPanel JWT. Users have granted NeonPanel access to their account on 3d party API 
like Amazon SP-API and QuickBooks. As soon as NeonPanel maintain their access tokens to 
those servers, it can generate authorised requests to their API.
So, mcp.neonpanel.com MCP server incide itself should be able to send user request derectly to NeonPanel API (provider = neonpanel)
or to SP API or QuickBooks API. So, this possibilities should we exposed to AI connected to 
NeonPanel MCP Server.
